This application is for any teachers, professors, tutors, students, or academics in general who want a custom and automated way to have assignments or answers graded against an answer key and a table to store the grades in. **The following formatting rules are required; All files must be pdfs, the student's answer files must have the title: Student Name_Assignment Name, the answers in the file must be one answer per line and have the format: Queston#:Answer, the answer key file must have the title: Assignment Name_Answer Key, and the answers in the answer key file must follow the same format as the answers in the students.** All files will be uploaded to an S3 bucket, which only contains the students answers and the answer key files. The FileProcessor Lambda Function is invoked via an HTTP POST request, the function grades the students answers against the answer key and then pushes the grades as a message to the QueueForGrades. The InsertGradesToDynamoDB function polls the queue, and when the grades are uploaded, inserts them as items into the StudentGradesTable. The GetAverageGrade function allows for a user to get the average grade for a specific assignment via a HTTP Get request which includes the Assignment Name. The GetGradesForAssignment function allows for a user to get all the students grades for a specific assignment via a HTTP GET request which includes the assignment name.
